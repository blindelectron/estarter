#estarter example configuration file 
#any thing that does not have a comment immediately after it is assumed to be self explanatory.
#about the at signs, you must put the name of what ever folder or app you are using the options for before the at sign. That is to say the second thing in the brackets for that config heading, e.g if you put [folder jumpy], for the source and destination you would put jumpy@source and jumpy@dest.
##example folder backup config 
###[folder test]
###test@source=path to source
###test@dest=path to destination
##example of app to close for afk monitor
###[clapp app1]
###app1@file=<app executable name>
###[clapp app2]
###app2@file=<app exicutable name>
